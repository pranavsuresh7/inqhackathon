Waste management is one of the biggest problems mankind is facing today. Specifically, the amount of non-biodegradable plastic waste in the environment is increasing at an alarming rate. Millions of animals are loosing their lives every year due to the accumulation of plastic waste in the environment. To solve this problem, we have to start at the very root of the problem. Our idea is to build a smart bin that at the very time the waste falls into the bin, it is segregated into recyclable or non-recyclable parts. That way the portion of the waste that is recyclable can be directly collected by some recycling organizations and thus we will have played our part in clearing this world of plastic.
